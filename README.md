# Drug Repurposing Using Llama LLM Model

## Project Overview
Llama LLM model AI-Chat from the local unsloth fine-tuning model
<!-- This project leverages the Llama LLM model to identify and validate potential drug repurposing opportunities for treating specific diseases. The goal is to accelerate the drug discovery process by using advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze medical literature and predict drug-disease relationships. -->
